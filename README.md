<h1>Aluminum Can Melter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This aluminum can melter was designed as part of an environmental initiative to recycle aluminum waste efficiently. The process begins with used aluminum cans being crushed and prepared for melting. The melter utilizes a controlled heating system to liquidify the aluminum, ensuring consistent quality and minimizing energy consumption. The molten aluminum is then cast into reusable forms, such as ingots or sheets, which can be repurposed for various applications. This project demonstrates an innovative approach to recycling, promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact through effective material reuse.
